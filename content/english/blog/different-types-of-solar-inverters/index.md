## Different Types of Solar Inverters ##

In general, solar inverters can be categorised under on-grid, off-grid and hybrid inverters.

+ **On-grid Inverter:** It converts DC to AC and sends any surplus energy to the grid. These inverters are connected to the utility grid as well.
+ **Off-grid Inverter:** It converts DC to AC from a battery. Such inverters can power many commercial and residential projects.
+ **Hybrid Inverter:** Similar to other types of inverters, a hybrid inverter converts DC to AC. However, it can be used with an on-grid system as well as an off-grid PV system.

## Comparing the Efficiency of Various Solar Inverters ##

An inverter’s efficiency is the ratio of output power to input power measured under specified working conditions. A solar inverter’s efficiency cannot be ignored while choosing a solar inverter. Further, not all inverters are suited for household applications. Thus, a prospective buyer must understand and research various inverters carefully before choosing one.

## Checking the Inverters for Durability ##

Buying a solar inverter can be a long-term investment for many. Thus, it is important to check and compare them for durability and performance under extreme weather conditions. Further, some inverters are not suited for high temperatures and may have performance issues. Hence, it is advisable to understand the specifications and pick the one that is resilient to rough atmospheric conditions.

## Budget Constraints ##

The cost of an inverter can vary largely depending upon its type. For buyers on a budget, a grid-connected inverter can be a great choice. By opting for it, users can save on their utility bills via net metering. Alternatively, off-grid inverters can be good for those who wish to minimise their dependency on the utility grid.

## Choosing a Brand ##

It is important to do some research about the brand of your choice. Taking a second opinion, and reading reviews and blogs can help in making an informed decision. Pick a brand that offers a competitive price along with a warranty.

## Estimating Your Requirements ##

A buyer must correctly estimate his energy requirements before buying a solar inverter. This is essential and will be needed for an inverter sizing strategy. For instance, if a user wants a [5kW system for solar panels](https://www.genusinnovation.com/solar-panel), then he must choose an inverter that will generate as much energy. Further, it is advisable to buy an inverter of slightly higher capacity than your estimated requirements as there can be some energy losses in the system as well.
The list will help you ensure that you do not miss out on any factor to be considered before investing in a solar inverter. Doing some research and gathering information about the product you plan to buy can save you from bad deals.
